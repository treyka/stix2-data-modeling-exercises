I was thinking about the IMDDOS example and the relatively minor
differences between the approaches we took.  One place where there
are more options is the specification of indicator patterns.  For
a list such as the C2 domains in IMDDOS, I could think of three
semantically-equivalent ways of expressing that pattern - using IN,
using MATCHES (as Trey did) and using comparison operators.  Maybe
there are others as well...  I don't think this is a problem but I
do want to point this out when we think about people consuming
patterns in their systems.  Each of these variants need to match
the same exact set of objects.

I've written out the patterns for reference. To keep these examples
shorter I'm assuming that there are only three C2 domains in IMDDOS:
dns.ddos.im, win2003ddos.3322.org, and woshindi.3322.org

Now while there are three semantically-equivalent ways of writing
the matches, there are also at least three reasonable choices someone
could make when mapping C2 domains from a report like IMDDOS to
STIX 2 indicator patterns.  These are NOT semantically equivalent
but in many environments or for many uses they may be practically
interchangeable.  I've written these out below.

#1) Use domain-name
domain-name:value IN ('dns.ddos.im', 'win2003ddos.3322.org', 'woshindi.3322.org')
domain-name:value MATCHES '^(dns.ddos.im|win2003ddos,3322.org|woshindi.3322.org)$'
domain-name:value = 'dns.ddos.im' OR domain-name:value = 'win2003ddos.3322.org' or domain-name:value = 'woshindi.3322.org'

#2) Use network-traffic without port
network-traffic:dst_ref.type = 'domain-name' AND ( network-traffic:dst_ref.value IN ( 'dns.ddos.im', 'win2003ddos.3322.org', 'woshindi.3322.org' )
network-traffic:dst_ref.type = 'domain-name' AND ( network-traffic:dst_ref.value MATCHES '^(dns.ddos.im|win2003ddos,3322.org|woshindi.3322.org)$'
network-traffic:dst_ref.type = 'domain-name' AND ( network-traffic:dst_ref.value = 'dns.ddos.im' OR network-traffic:dst_ref.value = 'win2003ddos.3322.org' OR network-traffic:dst_ref.value = 'woshindi.3322.org' )

#3) Use network-traffic with port
network-traffic:dst_ref.type = 'domain-name' AND ( network-traffic:dst_ref.value IN ( 'dns.ddos.im', 'win2003ddos.3322.org', 'woshindi.3322.org' ) AND network-traffic.dst_port = 9090
network-traffic:dst_ref.type = 'domain-name' AND ( network-traffic:dst_ref.value MATCHES '^(dns.ddos.im|win2003ddos,3322.org|woshindi.3322.org)$' AND network-traffic.dst_port = 9090
network-traffic:dst_ref.type = 'domain-name' AND ( network-traffic:dst_ref.value = 'dns.ddos.im' OR network-traffic:dst_ref.value = 'win2003ddos.3322.org' OR network-traffic:dst_ref.value = 'woshindi.3322.org' ) AND network-traffic.dst_port = 9090
